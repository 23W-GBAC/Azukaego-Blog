                <blockquote><img src="/original_images/sternmeme.jpg" alt="Image Description for the second opinion">"Maybe, It's just your anxiety," said the specialist to Mary.</blockquote>
              
                <p>Mary had been on regular visits to the physician for the past 4 years for her persistent chest burns, fatigue, and dizziness, abdominal pain, she had been experiencing various other symptoms and every visit felt like she was being gaslighted about the insistence of the severity of her symptoms before being referred to a specialist, a cardiologist. In other to get to see the cardiologist, Mary had to be put on a 6-month wait list, when she got to see the cardiologist after the long wait to iterate her symptoms all over again, only if he had even bothered to read her medical history or chart to ask if she had anything to add, instead of having to repeat herself. The cardiologist ordered a few laboratory tests, the same test that was taken by the previous physician and told her to reschedule another appointment for the result review when she got back from the laboratory. Oh! well, another 6months waitlist, If Mary could wait for 4 years and 6 months, what's another 6 months?. Mary was back again after waiting for another 6 months with the same cardiologist and after reviewing tests in his opinion all the tests came back okay by his standards. She replied about how she still didn't feel right or okay and felt sicker and sicker now and often and mid-sentence the cardiologist blurted out "Maybe It's just your anxiety". Mary sighs,</p>
              
                <blockquote>"I would like a second opinion"<img src="/output_images/blog_post_article_images/sigh_face1.png" alt="Image Description for the second opinion"></blockquote>
                
              
                <blockquote>"Is my ability to give you a prognosis being put on the line right now?, Don't be hysterical"...</blockquote>
                <img src="your-image-url2.jpg" alt="Image Description for the prognosis line">
              
                <p>Uhm, yeah quick to not forget the misogyny that still goes on in the healthcare industry when it comes to women and being constantly gaslighted about their symptoms being exaggerated. I mean the word 'hysteria' comes from the Greek root hystera, meaning ‘uterus’, not surprising. Mary replied</p>
              
                <blockquote>"Next to hysteria on my chart, indicate that I, the patient requested a second opinion"</blockquote>
                <img src="your-image-url3.jpg" alt="Image Description for the chart indication">
              
                <blockquote>"Okay, that would be $200, the bills will be forwarded to your insurance company."</blockquote>
                <img src="your-image-url4.jpg" alt="Image Description for the bill forwarding">
              
                <p>Fortunately, Mary was referred to another cardiologist who understood the importance of patient care juiced in empathy, collaborating with another specialist who is a Gastroenterologist to try and figure out a prognosis for Mary. They were able to figure out Mary's prognosis because the gastroenterologist had a  patient whose case was similar to that of Mary's and decided to run laboratory tests and various scans and probes in line with the patient's prognosis case. Mary was discovered to have stage 2 gastro cancer.  This is where the importance of collecting not just bulky data but quality data in research for treatment, detection, and prevention of illness and disease in healthcare. Mary was able to get a diagnosis due to another patient's medical quality data.</p></p>
